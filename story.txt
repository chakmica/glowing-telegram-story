Poppy was a small dog. She had black fur, with some white and brown on her
tummy, legs, and head. She lived with her owner, a witch, in a hollowed out
tree in a misty forest. Her owner, although a witch, was retired from evil 
and spent most of her days knitting and baking cookies for the forest gnomes
and gremlins. Poppy loved her owner very much and always accompanied her on
her hikes through the forest.
One day, a tall, strange man knocked at the door and came talk to her owner.
That was a cold long night, and they talked so long that Poppy did not even
know when she fell asleep. When the light comes in the morning, poppy found
that her owner were still sitting tightly, silently and coldly by the table.
Something seemed to be happening.
The sun rises up, and the forest was misty on that day.
The witch looked out from the window but she could not see anything.The birds 
were not singing on that morning. Poppy senses that there's something wrong inm
the forest. She tried to rush out to see what is happening, but the witch 
locked the door before Poppy tried to get out. Poppy smelled something unusual
in the forest and started yelling at the witch.

The witch told Poppy to be patient because she had a suprise for her. Poppy
listened to the witch and waited for a few minutes. There was a knock on the
door, and the witch opened it. The strange man was standing outside with his
dog. The witch let the strange man and his dog enter the house, and Poppy was
able to play with the other dog, while the strange man was talking to the witch.
Poppy was overfilled with joy that she had a new friend.

THE END
