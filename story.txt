Poppy was a small dog. She had black fur, with some white and brown on her
tummy, legs, and head. She lived with her owner, a witch, in a hollowed out
tree in a misty forest. Her owner, although a witch, was retired from evil 
and spent most of her days knitting and baking cookies for the forest gnomes
and gremlins. Poppy loved her owner very much and always accompanied her on
her hikes through the forest.
One day, a tall, strange man knocked at the door and came talk to her owner.
That was a cold long night, and they talked so long that Poppy did not even
know when she fell asleep. When the light comes in the morning, poppy found
that her owner were still sitting tightly, silently and coldly by the table.
Something seemed to be happening.
